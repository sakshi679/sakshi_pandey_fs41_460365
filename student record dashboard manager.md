# Student Record Manager

## Overview

Hey! So this is a simple Student Record Manager app that I made using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this project as part of my practice to understand DOM manipulation better. It doesn't use any external libraries or any backend — everything happens right in the browser.

## Features

Here’s what this project can do:

* I can add a new student by entering their name, batch, age, and score
* There’s form validation, so it doesn’t let me add blank or incorrect entries
* It shows all the student records in a table below the form
* I added Edit and Delete buttons for each row — Edit fills the form again for changes, and Delete removes the student
* There’s a search box to filter students by name as I type
* I also added sort buttons — one for sorting by age (ascending) and one for score (descending)
* It shows the total number of students and the average score
* And yes, students who scored more than 80 get highlighted in green

## Technologies I Used

* HTML (for the structure)
* CSS (just some basic styling)
* JavaScript (used only DOM, no frameworks or libraries)

## How I Use It

1. I fill out the form with all the student info
2. Then I click the Submit button to add it to the list
3. If I want to edit a student, I just click the Edit button beside them — it fills the form again and I can update it
4. The Delete button removes a student from the list
5. The search box helps me find students by name instantly as I type
6. Sort buttons change the order based on age or score

## Project Structure

I kept everything in a single HTML file to keep it simple.
JavaScript is written inside a `<script>` tag in the same file.


## Final Note

I made this project to improve my understanding of how JavaScript works with the DOM. It's a basic beginner-friendly app but I learned a lot while building it. I'm happy with how it turned out and planning to keep improving it as I learn more.

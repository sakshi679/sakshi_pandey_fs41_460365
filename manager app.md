# Task Manager Web App 🚀

This is a simple task manager web app I made as part of my assignment. I'm still learning web development, so I wanted to try how Firebase Authentication works along with fetch-based CRUD operations.

## 🔐 Features
- Firebase Authentication for Signup and Login
- After login, only that user can access the Task Manager screen
- Add tasks (title + description)
- Edit, Delete, and Mark tasks as complete
- Uses `fetch()` for all HTTP requests (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- Basic Bootstrap styling for clean UI

## 🔧 Tech Used
- Firebase Auth
- HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript
- JSONPlaceholder as mock API

Thanks for checking this out! 😊
